Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian emergency and the already vulnerable people of
Yemen are facing the added threat of COVID-19. This new burden on medical facilities could
result in a catastrophic death toll. WHO and the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief
Centre have joined forces to ensure access to healthcare for the vulnerable in remote areas
through the provision of a minimum service package.
UNICEF and WHO have supported a national immunization campaign in Syria amid the COVID-
19 pandemic. There has been about a 5% reduction in vaccination coverage in the first half of
"2020, mainly as a result of challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 5-day"
"immunization campaign, implemented by the Syrian Ministry of Health, health workers checked"
the vaccination status of more than 900 000 children and vaccinated more than 210 100
children.
"To promote community empowerment and trust, a ‘Global Risk Communication and"
"Community Engagement Collective Service’ has been launched by WHO, UNICEF and IFRC with"
support from the Global Outbreak and Response Network and the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation. See ‘Subject in Focus’ below for more information.
"","RCCE strategy produced by WHO, UNICEF, and IFRC, as well a"
the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan and the COVID-19 Globa,
Humanitarian Response Plan.,
