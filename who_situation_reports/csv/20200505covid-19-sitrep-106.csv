Every year on May 5 we celebrate Hand Hygiene Day to mobilize people around the world to increase
"adherence to hand hygiene practices in healthcare facilities. In his media briefing, the Director-General"
"reminded us that ‘around the world,  fewer than two-thirds of healthcare facilities are equipped with"
"hand hygiene stations, and 3 billion people lack soap and water at home’. Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh,"
"WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia,  said that ‘Effective infection prevention and control"
"measures, including hand hygiene, are crucial to ensuring health facilities do not become hubs of"
COVID-19 transmission’.
A WHO COVID-19 mission has arrived in Tajikistan to support the country’s response to the pandemic.
Today also marks the International Day of the Midwife. Midwives provide life-saving services to
"pregnant women, ensuring healthy outcomes for women and their babies. As the Director-General said"
"in his media briefing, ‘They’re risking their lives to give life to others.’ WHO Regional Office for Europe"
has released a news article of the experiences of a midwife in Italy.
Yesterday leaders from 40 countries  around the world came together to support the Access to COVID-
"19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a WHO initiative to support the development, production and equitable"
"distribution of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics against COVID-19. Some €7.4 billion  were pledged,"
in what  the Director-General  described as a ‘powerful and inspiring demonstration of global
solidarity’.
