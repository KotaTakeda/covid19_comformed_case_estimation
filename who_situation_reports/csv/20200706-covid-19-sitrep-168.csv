"COVID-19 has changed our life: disinfectants, hand sanitizers, and personal protective"
equipment (PPE) have become tools in the fight against virus transmission. Most of these
products contain chemicals. A webinar is being held tomorrow  during which speakers will
share the preliminary analysis of the chemical impact [of using these products] and outline
recommendations to ensure the safety of chemical products being used to stop the spreading
of the virus.
As a major United Nations forum prepares to assess progress towards a fairer future for people
"and the planet, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has warned that each of the Goals of"
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ below we present an update from the Global Outbreak Alert and
"Response Network (GOARN), which is supporting the COVID-19 response."
