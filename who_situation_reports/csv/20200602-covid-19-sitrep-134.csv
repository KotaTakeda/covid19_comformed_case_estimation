"During the 1 June media briefing, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros highlighted that the"
COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions in services for treatment of non-communicable
diseases in many countries. The COVID-19 response must be inclusive of the healthcare needs
of people living with these diseases.
"WHO has published a new operational guidance on maintaining essential health services,"
"which provides recommendations for practical actions that countries can take at national, sub-"
"regional and local levels to reorganize and safely maintain access to high-quality, essential"
health services during the pandemic.
Transporting COVID-19 medical supplies to those in need requires timely decision-making and
trouble-shooting skills. The Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean document a week in
the life of logistics expert coordinating massive shipments of medical supplies to Yemen.
WHO’s support to countries in securing medical products for COVID-19 treatment is
highlighted in the ‘Subject in Focus’ below.
