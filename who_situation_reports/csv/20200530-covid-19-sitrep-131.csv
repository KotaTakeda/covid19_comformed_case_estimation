WHO has published key planning recommendations for mass gatherings in the context
of the current COVID-19 outbreak. The document provides guidance on containing risks
of COVID-19 transmission associated with mass gathering events.
The UN and WHO have urged governments around the world to take the mental
"health consequences of the pandemic seriously, and ensure widespread availability of"
mental health support. WHO discusses this in a recently released article and has
published guidelines for communities and a children’s book.
An article released by WHO Regional Office for Europe introduces recently published
technical guidance on preventing and managing the COVID-19 pandemic across long-
term care services.
""
WHO has released a framework for decision-making that proposes a step-wise
approach to the assessment of the relative risks and benefits of conducting mass
vaccination campaigns in the context of COVID-19 (see ‘Subject in Focus’ below).
