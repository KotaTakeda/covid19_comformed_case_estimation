International Organization of Employers alone reaches 50 million businesses in 150 countries.  Among several other,
"entities and organizations, EPI-WIN has strong links with trade unions through the International Labour Organization",
"(ILO)’s the Bureau of Workers’ Activities (ACTRAV), the International Trade Union Confederation and the global",
"sectoral unions, reaching over 210 million workers and their families in 163 countries.",
"",
"To best respond to the need for timely information of these different audiences, EPI-WIN conducts regular calls with",
"the different sectors. On March 23rd, WHO and the International Occupational Medicine Society Collaboration",
(IOMSC) conducted a webinar on “Occupational Health Measures in the Preparedness and Response to COVID19 in,
the Workplace.” Approximately 225 participants registered for the webinar including IOMSC Occupational Medical,
Society members as well as other Occupational Medical Society physician leaders from around the world. Participant,
questions were notably around the themes of: workplace transmission of COVID-19; the use of masks and other,
personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare and other public-facing workers; the use of rapid tests for COVID-,
19 to screen workers in workplaces; “Return to Work” guidance; and mental health and psychosocial impacts in,
"workplaces, in particular health facilities.",
"",
"Two additional webinars are scheduled for Thursday, 26 March the first with the European Federation of Public",
"Service Unions (EPSU), representing 8 million workers, and the second a videoconference with the International",
Organization of Employers (IOE): “Summit on the collaboration of the private sector with health systems in,
emergency situations.”,
