A newly-released WHO scientific brief summarizes the current evidence on the impact of angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and receptor blockers on severe acute respiratory illness due to
COVID-19.
Pan American Health Organization and the United Nations Office for Project Services have published
"new guidelines on covid-19 prevention measures on construction projects, for workers to take"
measures to protect themselves from infection. The guidelines are only available in Spanish at this time.
"Due to a change in reporting system to align with figures published by the US CDC, counts for the United"
States of America were adjusted to 1 245 775 cases (-99 new cases) and 75 364 deaths (5475 new
deaths).
