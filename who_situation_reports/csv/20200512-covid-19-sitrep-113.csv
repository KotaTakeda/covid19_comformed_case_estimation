WHO has published a new guidance on Considerations for school-related public health measures in the
context of COVID-19 as an annex to earlier guidance on adjusting public health and social measures
published on 15 April 2020.
WHO has issued a Statement on Tobacco use and COVID-19. Tobacco smoking is a known risk factor for
many respiratory infections and increases the severity of respiratory diseases. A review of studies by
public health experts convened by WHO found that smokers are more likely to develop severe disease
"with COVID-19, compared to non-smokers. WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be"
cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19.
"The Director-General Dr. Tedros in his media briefing yesterday, urged a slow, steady, lifting of public"
"health and social measures (so called lockdowns), which is key to stimulating economies, while also"
keeping a vigilant eye on the virus so that control measures can be quickly implemented if an upswing in
cases is identified.
"In the ‘Subject in Focus’ below, WHO Operations and Support Logistics (OSL), in collaboration with a"
"technical network of universities, architects, biomedical engineers and other health experts, is working"
"to support the establishment of COVID-19 treatment centres, self-quarantine and community facilities at"
the request of countries seeking technical guidance in setting up such facilities.
