WHO has published new guidance on Surveillance strategies for COVID-19 human infection. The
document provides an overview of surveillance strategies that Member States should consider as part of
comprehensive national surveillance for COVID-19. It also emphasise the need to adapt and reinforce
existing national systems where appropriate and to scale-up surveillance capacities as needed.
WHO has published new guidance on Contact tracing in the context of COVID-19. When systematically
"applied, the guidance will help break the chains of transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious disease"
and is thus an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease outbreaks.
"In today’s ‘Subject in Focus’,  WHO provides an update on the work of the Emergency Medical Teams,"
"the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and Risk Communication and Community"
Engagement.
