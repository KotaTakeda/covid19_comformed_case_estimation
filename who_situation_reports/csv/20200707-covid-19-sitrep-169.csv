WHO encourages Member States to invest in and build longer-term health emergency preparedness during the
"COVID-19 pandemic. To support this goal, WHO has published guidance that maps COVID-19 preparedness and"
response actions; locates relevant supporting WHO resources; and advocates for the conscious and effective
allocation of COVID-19 funds to also meet countries’ longer-term needs.
A WHO survey has found that access to HIV medicines has been severely impacted by COVID-19. Seventy-three
countries have warned that they are at risk of stock-outs of antiretroviral (ARV) medicines as a result of the
"COVID-19 pandemic, according to  the survey conducted ahead of the International AIDS Society’s biannual"
conference.
The WHO Regional Office for America urges countries to continue the fight against malaria during the COVID-
"19 pandemic, especially among vulnerable communities. In the Americas, 138 million people live in areas at risk"
"of malaria, and some 765 000 cases and around 340 deaths were reported in 2018."
In today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ below we present an update from the WHO Information Network for Epidemics
(EPI-WIN) who have been holding a conference on exploring new interventions to tackle the infodemic.
