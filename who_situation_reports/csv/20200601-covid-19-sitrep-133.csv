WHO has published a case report form for suspected cases of multisystem inflammatory
syndrome (MIS) in children and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19
"During the last two weeks, WHO has delivered over 55 tons of health supplies by road to"
northeast Syria. These shipments contained equipment and medical supplies to treat
"many diseases, including COVID-19."
“Clean hands save lives” and “Applaud healthcare workers” campaigns celebrated in
"North Macedonia. Midwives and nurses were honored with applause, as over 500"
healthcare professionals were awarded the “Clean hands” certificate of recognition by
WHO.
"Since the start of the pandemic, there has been an urgent need to accelerate the research"
and development of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. WHO has been supporting this effort.
Currently over 120 candidate vaccines have been mapped and sites in 40 countries have
"expressed an interest to join the Vaccine Solidarity Trial. For more on this, see the ‘Subject"
in Focus’ below.
"",how to prioritize the ones that will go from early to later development (from phase I to
"",phase 2b/3 clinical trials).
•,"Developing specific criteria that vaccine scientists, product developers, manufacturers,"
"",regulators and funding agencies can use for prioritization.
•,"Outlining the desired characteristics for safe and effective vaccines, published in the WHO"
"",Target Product Profiles (TPP) for COVID-19 vaccines. The TPP outlines the preferred and
"",minimally acceptable profiles for a human COVID-19 vaccine for long-term protection of
"","persons at high ongoing risk of COVID-19, such as healthcare workers, and for reactive use"
"",in outbreak settings with rapid onset of immunity to guide vaccine development.
•,Developing a core protocol for a globally coordinated randomized controlled clinical trial for
"",vaccines. Recognizing the critical importance to world health of the rapid availability and
"","deployment of effective vaccines against COVID-19, on 9 April WHO published the core"
"","protocol for an international, multi-site, individually randomized controlled clinical trial that"
"",will enable the concurrent evaluation of benefits and risks of each promising candidate
"",vaccine within 3–6 months of it being made available for the trial.
•,Launching a call for expressions of interest from vaccine trial sites around the world using
