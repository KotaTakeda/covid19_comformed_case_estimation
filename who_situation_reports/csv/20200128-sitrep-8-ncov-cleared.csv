and community engagement.,,
WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans,,
"Activation of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics."
"WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including"
novel coronaviruses.
"WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,"

During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
"Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and"
"fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce"
the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:
""
•Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
"•Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment."
•Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
"•People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover"
"coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands)."
"•Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in"
emergency departments.
