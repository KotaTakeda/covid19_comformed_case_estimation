"In his opening remarks at the World Health Assembly, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros declared: ‘We"
have come together as the nations of the world to confront the defining health crisis of our time.’ In
"concluding he asserted that the COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that we need a healthier, safer and"
fairer world with a stronger WHO to support this goal.
Countries around the world have put in place a range of public health and social measures to suppress or
stop community spread of COVID-19. WHO has published a document to provide an overview of public
"health and social measures, and to propose strategies to limit any possible harm resulting from these"
interventions.
A new WHO report on the health behaviours of 11–15-year-olds in Europe reveals more adolescents
have been reporting mental health concerns. The results were based on data between 2014 and 2018
and provide a baseline against which future studies can measure the impact of COVID-19 on young
people’s lives.
The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific has released a timeline outlining some of the key
moments and actions to respond to COVID-19 in the Region.
