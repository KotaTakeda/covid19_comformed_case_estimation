"HIGHLIGHTS•No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.•Globally, the number of reported confirmed cases exceeded 2 million.•WHO has released public health guidance for social and religious practices andgatherings during Ramadan. The guidance also offers advice to strengthenmental and physical wellbeing as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Theguidance is available here.•WHO has released guidance on considerations in adjusting public health andsocial measures in the context of COVID-19. This document is intended fornational authorities and decision makers in countries that have introduced largescale public health and social measures. It offers guidance for adjusting publichealth and social measures, while managing the risk of a resurgence ofcases. The guidance is available here.•The Chinese authorities have informed WHO that as cases have declined inChina and the strain on the healthcare system has eased, a multisectoral teamwas established in late March 2020 to perform a comprehensive review ofCOVID-19 data in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Information from a variety of sourceswas reviewed, leading to duplicate cases being removed and missed casesadded. Following this review, the total number of cases in Wuhan increased by325 and the total number of deaths increased by 1290.•As of 11 April 2020, 167 countries, territories and areas have implementedadditional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic.An updated summary is outlined in the ‘Subject in Focus’ below.",
