Two new Member States (Comoros and Tajikistan) reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.
The third meeting of the Emergency Committee was convened by the WHO Director-General under the
International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding COVID-19.
"The WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge mentioned that “we will defeat COVID-"
"19 by disseminating knowledge in all transparency, by personalized support in the field and by"
"unfailing solidarity”. In another statement, he emphasized that “we cannot allow the impact of COVID-"
19 to be amplified by neglecting other vital health protection measures”.
The WHO Regional Office for the Americas urged health authorities to take specific steps to protect
health care workers and communities during essential immunization activities throughout the COVID-
19 pandemic.
WHO virtually convened vaccine manufacturers and national regulatory authorities from its South-
East Asia Region to discuss COVID-19 vaccines.
"In the Subject in Focus below, we describe WHO’s work to ensure that shipping and seafarers can"
"continue to deliver vital goods, including medical supplies and food during the COVID-19 pandemic"
