WHO has published a case-control protocol for the assessment of risk factors for coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) in health workers. The primary objective of this study is to characterize
and assess the risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers exposed to COVID-19
patients.
A scientific brief has been published by WHO investigating any association between smoking and
"an increased risk for COVID-19. At the time of this review, the available evidence suggests that in"
"hospitalized COVID-19 patients, smoking is associated with increased severity of disease and"
death.
WHO has published a population-based age-stratified seroepidemiological investigation protocol
"for COVID-19 virus infection. This protocol was designed to investigate the extent of infection,"
"as determined by positive blood tests in the general population, in any country in which COVID-"
19 virus infection has been reported.
Elements of the COVID-19 Strategic Response and Preparedness Plan (SPRP) have been
updated and are reviewed on a regular basis by WHO in consultation of all six regional offices.
These elements are laid out in the COVID-19 WHO Appeal.
"In today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ below, the WHO Infodemics management pillar explores how WHO is"
listening to social media to get ahead of the infodemic.
